    <h1>Inheritor of castle</h1>
    <p>An old noble owns a castle in Europe, but he had no wife and children. </p>
    <p>The noble left a <a href="/src/Message.txt" download="Message.txt">message</a> to the public. But no one knows the meaning of it.</p>
    <p>After the noble passed away, his lawer gives out a <a href="/src/public.pem" download="public.pem">public key</a>.<p>
    <p>To know what the noble said, we need to break the Message.</p>
    <p>The flag is the message itself.</p>
